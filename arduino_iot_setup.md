# Arduino IoT Cloud Setup (Guide)

1) Create a Thing in Arduino IoT Cloud with a boolean variable `flameDetected` (Read & Write).
2) Pair your ESP8266 device and download the Device ID/Secret.
3) In the sketch, update your Cloud credentials (or use `config.h`).
4) Verify the variable updates when flame is detected.
5) Use the Arduino IoT Remote app to view the variable in real time.
